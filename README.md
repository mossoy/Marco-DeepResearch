## Introduction

**Marco DeepResearch** is a comprehensive initiative from Alibaba International Digital Commerce that advances real-world AI agent capabilities through challenging benchmarks and practical applications. Our work bridges the gap between AI agents and human experts by exposing and addressing critical limitations in domain-specific reasoning, hierarchical rule application, and large-scale information seeking.

</div>

### 🎯 Key Achievements

We introduce a suite of benchmarks, frameworks and models that evaluate and advance agents across fundamental dimensions essential for real-world deployment:

- **🏆 HSCodeComp**: Tests hierarchical rule application with **95.0% human performance** vs. **46.8% best AI** (SmolAgent + GPT-5 VLM)
- **🏆 DeepWideSearch**: Challenges deep-and-wide information seeking with **414 avg. information units** and **4.21 avg. reasoning depth**
- **🏆 Table-as-Search**: Production-ready hierarchical multi-agent framework demonstrating the **"scissor gap effect"** on challenging benchmarks
- **🏆 UMEM**: Self-evolving memory system that avoids the "rote memorization trap" through joint optimization of memory extraction and management

These benchmarks and frameworks reveal and address fundamental gaps in current AI systems for:
- Complex hierarchical decision-making in vertical domains (tariff, legal, medical, taxation)
- Simultaneous wide-scale exploration and deep multi-hop reasoning
- Structured information organization and synthesis
- Generalizable long-term memory that evolves without overfitting

## 🌟 Marco DeepResearch in Practice

Real-world deployment showcases how our research frameworks address critical challenges in Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group's business scenarios.

### 📊 Business Development (BD) Intelligence for DeepWideSearch Tasks

**Challenge:** BD tasks require both **breadth** (finding many qualified merchants across platforms) and **depth** (multi-hop extraction of contact details from official sites). ReAct-style baselines suffer from unclear planning, state confusion, and coverage gaps on the [DeepWideSearch](Marco-DeepResearch-Family/DeepWideSearch/) benchmark.

**Our Solution: Table-as-Search** — We formalize long-horizon search as **table completion**: explicit state tracking, clear planning from the partially-filled table, and hierarchical orchestration of Wide (tabular) and Deep (multi-hop) sub-agents.

**Results:** On our real-world scenario Business Development datasets, Table-as-Search delivers **40%+ gain** on hard tasks (Success Rate 15.2% → 55.8%), with Entity Recall 89.3% (vs. 62.1%) and Attribute Completeness 85.7% (vs. 58.4%). Deployed in BD workflows, it significantly improves the working efficiency.

### 🏷️ HSCode Classification for Cross-Border Trade

**The Problem: Hierarchical Rule Application in a Vertical Domain**

Predicting a destination country’s 10-digit HS code and tariff from incomplete product information (e.g., from an ERP or catalog) requires **hierarchical rule application**: tariff rules have vague boundaries and implicit logic, making precise application challenging for agents. See our benchmark paper [HSCodeComp](assets/HSCodeComp.pdf) for task formulation and related work.

**Our Approach: Benchmark First, Then Tool-Augmented Agents**

We first established the **HSCodeComp** benchmark and found that state-of-the-art agents perform poorly—far below human experts. We then designed an agent-based framework with Marco as the orchestrator: (1) **multi-modal input parsing** (titles, attributes, images → normalized attributes), (2) **retrieval-augmented reasoning** via Deep Search (historical labels, expert knowledge, customs rulings), (3) **tool-integrated verification** (tariff lookup, chapter/section notes, ruling validation), and (4) **structured output** with an auditable evidence trail.

**Results: Clear Gain vs. Baselines, Large Gap vs. Humans**

On 10-digit HS code accuracy, Marco Agent reaches **65.0%** Top-1, outperforming GPT-5–based agents (46.8%), Agentorchestra (41.3%), and Claude Sonnet 4 (11.9%). As shown below, tool-augmented decision-making substantially improves over general-purpose agents. Nevertheless, a large gap remains versus human experts (95.0%), indicating **significant room for further improvement**.

### 💬 Customer Service Intelligence (Self-Evolving Agent)

**The Problem: Rules Are Subtle and Shifting**

In e-commerce commodity auditing are multi-modal, subtle, and constantly evolving. When the agent’s decision disagrees with expert labels (e.g., misidentifying a branded product as "counterfeit"), fixing behavior used to require **3–5 days of manual tuning**.

**Our Approach: Self-Evolving Agent + UMEM**

The **Self-Evolving Agent** learns from the gap between agent judgment and expert ground truth: it extracts nuances and integrates them into long-term memory. The engine is **UMEM** (Unified Memory Extraction and Management), which distills interaction traces into actionable and generalizable insights instead of merely retrieving past data. The loop is **Action → Rewarding** (compare with ground truth, detect badcases) **→ Memory Extraction** (reflect, generate candidate rules) **→ Validation** (safety gate, then update memory or retry).

**Results: 30–50× Faster Tuning, Quality Gains**

The workflow is compressed from 3–5 days to a **~10-minute autonomous cycle**. The self-evolving agent outperforms human-optimized baselines by **+11%** on white-background image auditing and **+2%** on short title review. On benchmarks, **UMEM** consistently outperforms state-of-the-art memory baselines (ReMem, Memp) across environments.
Besides, we also evaluate our UMEM on other reasoning benchmarks (below figure). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed UMEM could learn highly generalizable memory that improves the performance of future tasks.
